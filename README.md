# COVID Vaccination Analysis using SQL

Project Overview

This project showcases my data analysis and exploration skills using SQL, leveraging a COVID vaccination dataset. I began by cleaning and preprocessing the data in Excel, then split it into two tables for efficient querying. Next, I utilized SQL to uncover valuable insights and trends within the data.

The dataset used in this project is a COVID vaccination table, containing information on vaccination rates, demographics, and geographic locations.

Data Preprocessing

To prepare the data for analysis, I:

- Cleaned the data in Excel to remove duplicates and handle missing values
- Split the data into two tables: vaccinations and demographics

SQL Analysis

Using SQL, I performed various queries to:

- Explore vaccination rates by region and age group
- Analyze the effectiveness of vaccination campaigns
- Identify trends in vaccination uptake over time

This repository contains:

- covid_vaccinations.xlsx: The original dataset in Excel format
- vaccinations.sql: The SQL queries used for analysis
- demographics.sql: The SQL queries used for analysis
